# Elbie

Elbie is a rust library to be used for generating words in a fictional language. This isn't just a random word generator. It uses rules based on the way natural human languages work. You define the phonemes and the patterns used to generate words, and it does the work. It will also let you generate spelling systems for them.

Also included is a simple tool called "goblin", which can be used as an example of how to build your own tools. The language is based on some words used by those people in a certain popular role-playing game.

Elbie is a work in progress which I created for my own personal use. I'm releasing it into the wild because I feel that others might have use for it too. If you find it to be of any use, let me know.
